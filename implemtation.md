**Implementation Plan**

Let’s translate your working prototype into a **clear feature‑by‑feature implementation plan** — mapping out exactly what needs building (database schema → API → UI) so you can start coding straight away.

## 🎯 Core MVP Features (in priority order)

| Feature | Data Model (key fields) | API endpoints | Front‑end route/component | Next Development Task |
|---------|-------------------------|---------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Equipment CRUD** | Equipment(id, name, serial, location, created_at) | GET/POST/PUT/DELETE `/api/equipment` | `/equipment` (List + Form) | Build Django model + DRF viewset + React form |
| **Calibration Scheduling** | Calibration(id, equipment_id, due_date, status, certificate_url) | GET/POST/PUT/DELETE `/api/calibrations` | `/calibrations` (Calendar + Form) | Create model, serializer, calendar UI |
| **Certificate Upload** | certificate_url stored on AWS S3 | POST `/api/calibrations/:id/upload` | File upload control in Calibration detail | Integrate Django S3 storage + React file input |
| **Maintenance Tasks** | Maintenance(id, equipment_id, due_date, status, notes) | GET/POST/PUT/DELETE `/api/maintenance` | `/maintenance` (List + Form) | Duplicate Calibration flow with separate model |
| **Dashboard** | Aggregated counts via ORM queries | GET `/api/dashboard` | `/dashboard` (Cards & charts) | Write aggregated DRF endpoint + React cards |
| **CSV Export** | N/A | GET `/api/export?type=calibrations` | “Export” button on Dashboard | Use Django `csv.writer` to stream file |

## 🚀 Week 1 Roadmap

1. **Database + API scaffolding**  
   - Define Django models for Equipment, Calibration, Maintenance  
   - Auto‑generate DRF routers/viewsets  
2. **Frontend CRUD pages**  
   - Equipment list + modal form  
   - Calibration scheduling form (due_date picker)  
3. **Certificate upload**  
   - Configure AWS S3 in Django settings  
   - Build React file input → POST upload  
4. **Basic dashboard**  
   - API endpoint returning total/pending/overdue counts  
   - React cards displaying metrics

## 🔨 Tech Checklist

- ✅ Django models + migrations  
- ✅ DRF serializers & viewsets  
- ✅ React Router v6 routes  
- ✅ Form validation (Yup + React Hook Form)  
- ✅ AWS S3 file storage  
- ✅ GitHub Actions job for backend tests  
- ✅ Docker Compose service definitions  

---

## 📈 Next Steps

1. Pick one feature (Equipment CRUD) and push a working prototype  
2. Review and merge PR with tests (pytest + React Testing Library)  
3. Repeat cycle for Calibration scheduling → Certificate upload → Maintenance → Dashboard → Export
